### Hi there 👋

I'm Narendra! I'm an experienced software engineer who has written programs that directly or indirectly bring a lot of joy to millions of people. I am based in Bangalore - Silicon Valley of India.

#### 👨‍💻 One of the cool open projects which I got to work on recently!
- [flipkart-incubator/gojira](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/gojira) - A record and replay-based regression testing tool for Java applications.

#### 👨‍💻 My Blog
- [narendravardi.com](https://www.narendravardi.com/) - My contributions to open source are minimal these days but I make up for it by writing tech blogs on my website. If you liked any of my articles, consider subscribing! :) I won't spam your inbox, a maximum of a single article in a week.
