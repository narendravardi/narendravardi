### Hi there 👋

I'm Narendra! I'm an experienced software engineer who have written programs that directly or indirectly bring a lot of joy to millions of people. Based in Bangalore - Silicon Valley of India.

#### 👨‍💻 One of the cool open project which I got to work on recently!
- [flipkart-incubator/gojira](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/gojira) - A record and replay based regression testing tool for java applications.

My contributions to open source is very limited these days because of several other commitments. If you think you are working on a cool open source project and need a hand, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn ! :)
